Umbraco Relations Picker (beta)
version 1.0
by Asbjørn Riis-Knudsen

This is a relations picker for Umbraco v7 (only tested on v. 7.2.2 at the moment). The UI is identical to the Umbraco Content Picker - it just saves as a relation instead.

Once you have installed the package, go to Developer > Data Types and create a new data type to use it. Remember to pick a relation type here.

This is a beta. It works in my testing, but there could be potential issues. For example, the error handling is insufficient at the moment. This will be fixed in the next version.
